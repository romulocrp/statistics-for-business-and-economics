My codes for solving the book Statistics for Business and Economics, David R. Anderson, Dennis J. Sweeney and Thomas A. Williams, 11ยบ Edition

These are Jupyter Notebooks, the exercises are described like:
# Exercise number.
# Exercise letter

Some letters are solved in the same coding and each cell is an exercise.

The answers will be unified in the future.

Cheers!
